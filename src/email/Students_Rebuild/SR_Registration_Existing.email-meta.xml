    <subject>Students Rebuild Registration - Welcome Back!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!CampaignMember.FirstName},

Welcome Back to Students Rebuild!

Thanks for signing up for the Ocean Challenge. As you may know, this is more than an art project, it’s a global community—so we&apos;re glad you&apos;re back.

You&apos;ll find everything you need to dive into our new Ocean Challenge on our Resource Page (http://www.studentsrebuild.org/resources). From our Leader Guide with in-depth Challenge details, to new Teaching Guides based on the time you have, to special videos—we&apos;ve created all these tools with you in mind.

Have a question about the Challenge? Find the answer here (http://www.studentsrebuild.org/ocean-faq) or email us (info@studentsrebuild.org).

Don&apos;t forget to share photos of the sea creatures you make on social media using #SROCEAN (and make sure to tag @StudentsRebuild)!

We are so happy you&apos;ve joined us again.

The Students Rebuild Team
