    <textOnly>Hi {!CampaignMember.FirstName},



Thank you for your contribution. We are so excited to receive your package! It typically takes about 3-4 weeks to receive and process each package, but you can expect another message from us when we receive your art.


Please print this email which is your submission slip to include if you&apos;re mailing your items to Students Rebuild at:


Students Rebuild

2400 1st Ave South #336

Seattle, WA 98134



Because of the incredible work of your team, we will be donating to support ocean health and coastal communities. Check out our partner page to learn more about the projects you’re helping to fund!



Be sure to celebrate your team&apos;s hard work too! A Participation Certificate is available for you to share with your team. You can also continue to utilize the Ocean Challenge learning resources and, if you&apos;d like, create additional sea creatures for submission all the way up until the Challenge ends on June 8, 2019.



Thanks again for being part of the Students Rebuild global community!
