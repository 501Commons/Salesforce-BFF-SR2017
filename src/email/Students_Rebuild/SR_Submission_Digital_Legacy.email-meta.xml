    <textOnly>Hi {!CampaignMember.FirstName},



Thank you for your contribution. We&apos;re excited to see photos of your sea creatures! Please email group photos or pictures of select art pieces to us at info@studentsrebuild.org.



Because of the incredible work of your team, we will be donating to support ocean health and coastal communities. Check out our partner page to learn more about the projects youâ€™re helping to fund!



Be sure to celebrate your team&apos;s hard work too! A Participation Certificate is available for you to share with your team. You can also continue to utilize the Ocean Challenge learning resources and, if you&apos;d like, create additional sea creatures for submission all the way up until the Challenge ends on June 8, 2019.



Thanks again for being part of the Students Rebuild global community!
