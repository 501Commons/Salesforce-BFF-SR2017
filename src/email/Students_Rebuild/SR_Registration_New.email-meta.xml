    <textOnly>Hi {!CampaignMember.FirstName},

Welcome to Students Rebuild and our global community!

By signing up for the Ocean Challenge you have joined tens of thousands of teams that have helped impact global issues since 2010.

Ready to dive in but not sure where to start? All the resources you need to get going can be found online on the Ocean Challenge Resource page (http://www.studentsrebuild.org/resources). From our Leader Guide with in-depth Challenge details, to new Teaching Guides based on the time you have, to special videosâ€”we&apos;ve created all these tools with you in mind.

You can also share photos of the sea creatures you make on social media using #SROCEAN (and make sure to tag @StudentsRebuild). We&apos;d love to see them!

Have a question about the Challenge? Find the answer here (http://www.studentsrebuild.org/ocean-faq) or email us (info@studentsrebuild.org.

We&apos;re so happy you&apos;ve joined us.

The Students Rebuild Team
