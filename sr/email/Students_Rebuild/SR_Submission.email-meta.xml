    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},



Thanks for submitting your final numbers to Students Rebuild! We&apos;re so grateful you and your team took part in the Students Rebuild Challenge.



We&apos;re excited to see your self-portraits arrive in the mail or receive the digital images! Print this email which is your submission slip to include if you&apos;re mailing your items to Students Rebuild at:

Students Rebuild

2400 1st Ave South #336

Seattle, WA 98134



Now, it&apos;s time to celebrate your team&apos;s hard work. A Participation Certificate is available for you to distribute to all your team members on our Challenge Resources page.



Please continue to utilize the learning resources and, if you&apos;d like, create additional self-portraits for submission.



Once the Challenge ends on May 4th, 2018, be on the lookout for a final survey and our Student Impact Report. We&apos;ll be sure to email both to you!



Have a question about the Challenge? Find the answer here or email us.

Thanks again,

The Students Rebuild Team
